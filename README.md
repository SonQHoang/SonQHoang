- 👋 Hi, I’m Sean Hoang!
- 👀 I’m interested in gaining a more solid understanding of the complexities of react as I level up my front-end skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently digging deeper into React and working with a colleague to 'Reactify' the frontend of their app.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to entering the tech world as a software engineer!
- 📫 Feel free to connect with me at: hoangseanq@gmail.com
